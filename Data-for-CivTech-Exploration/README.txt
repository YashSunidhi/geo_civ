These data are provided by Scottish Forestry to companies on the Exploration phase of CivTech Challenge 9.1.

These data are not for wider distribution or use on any alternative purpose.

The data are provided as a shapefile indicating the area of search identified from helicopter photographs to be 
further investigated. The polygons are drawn as close around symptomatic trees as practical i.e. symptomatic trees growing close together may be 
represented in one polygon so polygons may include a proportion of healthy trees. 

The suspected pest is detailed - notice there are many more references to some pests/diseases than others
and this changes over time. This relates to the status of the pathogen i.e. if it was / is a quarantine pest that we have a legal
responsibility to systematically survey for.

Data were retrieved 24 Oct 2023; columns containing comments that identify staff, owner/occupiers or other personally
identifying information were removed; rows were filtered to exclude observations made in 2023. The data are otherwise
provided as shown in the Tree Health Database with no further processing so may be subject to spelling errors / other issues with quality.
